        Lower values of priorty are updated before higher ones. If this seems
        backwards to you, use the phrase "this is my number one priority" to
        help you remember.

                         dictionary object. During the configuration phase,
                         this dictionary is passed to each instrument through
                         this function so that relevant instrument data can be
                         recorded into it. Instruments should record

                         but is also specific to the instrument. For example,
                         if an instrument is using one of many filters during
                         this experiment, it would be appropriate to record the

                              experiment and can therefore use this value to
