    This module allows PLACE to set configuration options on the preamp at the
    start of an experiment. Currently, the module does not provide automation
    during an experiment. this module is a *convenience only* module designed
    to assist in recording the preamp setting used in an experiment.

    It should also be noted that the preamp is configured only as a listening
    serial port, meaning that the instrument settings cannot be read back from
    the instrument. Therefore, in an automated experiment, PLACE has no way to
    verify that the desired settings are being registered by the instrument.
    Users are advised to adequately test the communication with the instrument
    before leaving PLACE to perform a large experiment.

    .. note::
        A serial_search function is not available for this instrument
        as it is listen-only and cannot send back a response to
        indicate that it is connected.
